## Taylor Sullivan-Peters
Most of my recent output has been under my own name.

My most recent album, entitled [Every Day Carry](https://taylorksullivanpeters.bandcamp.com/album/every-day-carry), was an attempt to come to terms with a melody I've had stuck in my head for about a decade off and on. I wanted to go deep on what it feels like to be a person walking around every day, freighted by all these memories and ideas that mostly never go any further than the inside of your head. 

## With Other People 
Last October I released a soundtrack to an unrealized horror short entitled *The Light in the Stable.* with my good friend Michael Latella: [The Light in the Stable OST](https://culturevacuum.bandcamp.com/album/the-light-in-the-stable-ost)
