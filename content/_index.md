For now, Eyewool International is me, Taylor Sullivan-Peters. I'm a musician and electrical engineer in Indianapolis, IN. 

Eyewool International hardly counts as a company, but we're getting there.  

To purchase things, please kindly [email me](mailto:eyewoolinternational@gmail.com) and we'll work it out. At some point we'll get cooking with eCommerce but probably not today. 

Five percent of all proceeds from Eyewool International will be donated to [Central Indiana DSA](https://www.centralindsa.org/). 

This site was built using [Platen](https://platen.io/), which I cannot recommend highly enough.
