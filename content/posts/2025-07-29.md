## Upcoming Shows
<img src="/posts/images/jhs.jpg">

I've got two shows booked in August, one on August 8th in Indianapolis, and another on August 21st up in Muncie. The Muncie show is at the [Common Market](https://www.instagram.com/munciecommonmarket/?hl=en) at Crawling Giants' monthly experimental music night. I played back in February and it was a great time and looking forward to getting up there again.  

The August 8th show warrants a little more detail. I'll be joining the multi-media event Johnny's Happy Spot at the Irving Theater in Irvington. Tickets are $10 in advance and you can grab them here: [Ticket Link](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/johnnys-happy-spot-irving-theater-tickets-1514033197049?aff=oddtdtcreator)

This event is way more than just a standard show, here's a little bit of a description from the organizers: 

> Johnnyâ€™s Happy Spot is a multi-media/multi-disciplinary art presentation about a young man getting lost on his way his way home from his 9-5. Johnny is a musician, and his only dream in life is to play Hawaiian music on his ukulele. One afternoon, on his way home, he steps onto the wrong bus which takes him into different dimensions of his own reality. He must battle multiple obstacles to complete his journey to his happy spot. This is a one night only performance and will be filmed for the creation of an experimental film. Expect experimental/ambient/noise music with visual artistry and modern interpretive dance. COSTUMES are ENCOURAGED!
